(1, 'Kilmainham Gaol Museum turns the clock back a few decades, offering you a look \n        inside one of history\'s most notorious prisons. The imposing gray building played a key role in Irish history \n        for over a century, finally closing its doors in 1924. Before then it provided a grim setting for the imprisonment \n        of notable participants in the many uprisings for Irish independence, culminating in the execution of 14 men who \n        led a rebellion that took place during Easter week in 1916. You can take a guided walk through the history of this \n        eerie site, now one of Europe\'s largest unoccupied structures of its kind.
