(1, 'Dublin', 'A history spanning over a thousand years, vibrant nightlife, and a mix of \n        Georgian and modern architecture make Dublin a popular European tourist destination. Founded as a \n        Viking settlement in the 9th century, this sprawling urban center often surprises visitors with its sheer size. \n        Nearly 2 million people live in the greater Dublin region, which represents well over a third of Ireland\'s total \n        population. The city center, however, remains a relatively compact area, easily explored on foot or by bicycle. \n        To experience the garrulous locals and their culture in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere, spend some time in a \n        traditional pub--a staple of Dublin\'s social life and a favorite stop for the majority of the city\'s foreign \n        visitors.', 'default-image.png', 1, '2020-02-27 17:47:02', '2020-02-27 17:47:02'),
